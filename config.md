# Configuration

As we work on Exogress, we will eventually introduce new and non-backward-compatible functionality
Config version following [semantic versioning rules](https://semver.org/). However, PATCH version relates to "bug fixes", which is unnecessary for the configuration file formats, so expect "0" in most cases.

Exofile documentation is sectioned based on the MAJOR version. The functionality is introduced in the MINOR version and placed on the field documentation.

- [Version 1](/config-1_x_0)
